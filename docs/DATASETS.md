| Dataset | Description | Source | Percentage in Training Mixture (RT-2-PaLI-X) | Percentage in Training Mixture (RT-2-PaLM-E) |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| WebLI | Around 10B image-text pairs across 109 languages, filtered to the top 10% scoring cross-modal similarity examples to give 1B training examples. | Chen et al. (2023b), Driess et al. (2023) | N/A | N/A |
| Episodic WebLI | Not used in co-fine-tuning RT-2-PaLI-X. | Chen et al. (2023a) | N/A | N/A |
